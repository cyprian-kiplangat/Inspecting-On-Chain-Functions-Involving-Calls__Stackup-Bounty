##### Function Code:
```solidity
function safeApprove(address token, address to, uint value) internal {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x095ea7b3, to, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'TransferHelper: APPROVE_FAILED');
}
```
##### Used Methods: `abi.encodeWithSelector`, `abi.decode`, and `call`
##### Explanation

- **Purpose**: The `safeApprove` function is designed to safely approve a specified amount of tokens to be transferred from the caller's account to another address. This is a critical operation in DeFi applications, enabling users to authorize others to spend tokens on their behalf.

- **Detailed Usage**:
  - **Encoding**: The function begins by using `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the function signature and parameters for the `approve` function of the ERC20 token contract. The function signature `0x095ea7b3` corresponds to the `approve(address,uint256)` function in the ERC20 standard. This encoded data is then sent via a low-level `call` to the token contract.
  - **Decoding**: After sending the call, the function checks the response. If the call was successful (`success` is true), it further validates the response by attempting to decode the returned data using `abi.decode`. The expected outcome is a boolean indicating the success of the approval. If the decoded data matches the expected boolean value (true), the function concludes that the approval was successfully processed.
  - **Using `call`**: The `call` method is used here to perform a low-level call to the token contract. This method allows the function to interact with the contract in a flexible manner, bypassing the type checking and automatic encoding/decoding provided by higher-level function calls. This is particularly useful for interacting with contracts that may not adhere strictly to the ERC20 standard or when needing to pass custom data formats.

- **Impact**: The `safeApprove` function plays a pivotal role in the DeFi ecosystem by ensuring that token approvals are performed securely and reliably. By using low-level calls and carefully validating the responses, it mitigates risks associated with token approvals, such as reentrancy attacks or incorrect state updates. This function's reliability is crucial for DeFi applications, as it enables complex interactions between users, contracts, and tokens while maintaining trust and security.
